\begin{exmp}
	Consider the projective space $\PP^2(\CC)$: this is  $\CC^2$ plus an additional point ``at infinity'' for each complex line through the origin.

	``How many'' new points are there? There is one for each complex line. In fact, if we look to the ``slope'' of each complex line, it lives inside $\PP(\CC)$ and uniquely identifies each complex line.
