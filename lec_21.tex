\begin{lem}
	A power series and its term-by-term differentiation (i.e., given $\sum_{n=0} a_nz^n$, its term-by-term differentiation is  $\sum_{n=1}^\infty na_nz^{n-1}$) have the same radius of convergence.
\end{lem}

\begin{thm}
	Let $\rho$ be the radius of convergence of $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nz^n0$. Then the function $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nz^n$ is holomorphic in $B_\rho(0)$. And, the derivative of  $f$ is gotten by doing ter-by-term differentiation.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
	Any holomorphic function on $\mathbb{C}$ can be expressed as a power series. \emph{(Key idea: Taylor series.)}
\end{thm}
