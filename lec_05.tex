\begin{exmp}
	\[
		y^2 = ...
	\]
	yields a sphere on $\PP^2(\CC)$.
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
	\[
		y^2 = x(x^2 - 1)
	\]
	yields a torus on $\PP^2(\CC)$.
\end{exmp}

\begin{thm}[WRONG! Dream Theorem]

\end{thm}

\begin{exmp}
	The polynomial $p(x, y) = xy$ yeilds to two spheres that touch at one point in $\PP^(\CC^2)$; which is not on the list.
\end{exmp}

\begin{thm}[Correct Theorem]
	If $p \in \CC[x, y]$ ...
\end{thm}
